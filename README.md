E-Procurement project for the clients for karam industries to optimize and robust their work .

e-Procurement or electronic procurement refers to the process of purchase and sale of goods or services through electronic methods, primarily the Internet. It is an alternative to the manual process of procurement, and is certainly superior to the latter in many respects. Organizations are increasingly opting for e-Procurement platforms, realizing its potential to curb irregularities and unnecessary costs.


# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

A requirements specification for a software system is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed and it includes a set of use cases that describe all the interactions the users will have with the software. In addition to use cases, the SRS also contains non-functional requirements. 

Non-functional requirements are requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance engineering requirements, quality standards, or design constraints). Requirements are a sub-field of software engineering that deals with the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software.

The software requirement specification document enlists all necessary requirements for project development. To derive the requirements, we need to have clear and thorough understanding of the products to be developed. This is prepared after detailed communications with project team and the customer.
